<t>Wallet and the Verifier MUST implement BLE according to the <eref target="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/core-specification-4-0/">Bluetooth Core Specification 4.0</eref>.</t>
<t>Wallet and the Verifier MUST support LE Data Packet Length Extension.</t>
<t>ToDo: For the wallet, mDL mandates 4.0, and recommends 4.2. and LE data Pathet Length Extension. For the reader, 4.2 and LE Data Packet Length Extension is mandated and 5.0 and LE 2M PHY is recommended.</t>
<t>The protocol consists of the following two steps:</t>

<ol>
<li><t>Establishing a connection</t>
</li>
<li><t>Exchanging verifiable credentials</t>
</li>
</ol>
<t>During step 1, ephemeral keys to encrypt the session are exchanged.</t>
<t>Step 2 utilizes request and response syntax defined in [OpenID4VP] specification. Response type <tt>vp_token</tt> MUST be used to obtain the VP Token in Authorization Response.</t>

<t>Wallet and the Verifier MUST support the Central role. The Wallet MUST act as GATT client. This is called client central mode.</t>
<t>ToDo: rename central client mode as being less ISOy?</t>
<t>The UUID’s used MUST be 16-byte UUID’s that are unique for the transaction. The Peripheral device MUST broadcast the service with the UUID as received during device engagement in the advertising packet. The Central device is then able to scan for the UUID and connect to the advertised service. However, the Central device may use a different mechanisms to identify the Peripheral device.</t>
<t>NOTE BLE stacks in mobile devices can use scan filter and caching methods to manage congested environments and manage scan intervals for device energy consumption control. This can influence the connection time required when using UUIDs for the identification of the Peripheral device.</t>
<t>NOTE Finding the correct device to connect to is purely a practical problem. Connecting to the wrong Verifier does not have security implications, since due to the security methods described in Clause 9, the Wallet and Verifier will not setup a session with the wrong Verifier. Note however, that these mechanisms do not provide complete protection against a bad actor aiming to cause a denial of service attack by advertising as a fake Verifier</t>

<section anchor="service-definition"><name>UUID for Service Definition</name>
<t>The Verifier service MUST contain the following characteristics, since the Verifier acts as the GATT server. The service MAY contain other properties.</t>

<t>Each service characteristic that has the Notify property MUST contain the Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor, with UUID ‘0x29 0x02’ and default value of ‘0x00 0x00’. This value MUST be set to ‘0x00 0x01’ by the GATT client to get notified for the characteristic associated to this descriptor.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="connection-state-values"><name>Connection State Values</name>
<t>After the connection is setup the GATT client subscribes to notifications of characteristic ‘State’ and ‘Server2Client’. For performance reasons, the GATT client should request for an as high an MTU as possible. After these steps, the GATT client makes a write without response request to ‘State’ where it sets the value to 0x01. This tells the GATT server that the GATT client is ready for the transmission to start.</t>
<t>The connection state is indicated by the ‘State’ characteristic. It is encoded as 1-byte binary data. Table 13 describes the different connection state values, which are communicated using write without response and notify.</t>

<t>OpenID4VP Request starts when GATT Client (Wallet) signals <tt>Start</tt> value to the <tt>State</tt> charateristic.</t>
<t>When the GATT server (Verifier) wants to send a message to the GATT client (Wallet), it divides the message in parts with a length of 3 bytes less than the MTU size. It then sends these parts to the GATT client using the notify command via the ‘Server2Client’ characteristic. The first byte of each part is either 0x01, which indicates more parts are coming, or 0x00, to indicate it is the last part of the message.</t>

<section anchor="connection-re-establishment"><name>Connection re-establishment</name>
<t>In case of a lost connection before the ‘state’ characteristic has been set to a value of 0x01 (e.g. the transmission has not yet started), the Wallet and Verifier should terminate their current BLE session and try to reconnect according to <xref target="setup-request"></xref>. In case of a lost connection after the 'state' characteristic has been set to value 0x01 (e.g. the transmission of data has started), a connection MUST NOT be re-established and a completely new Wallet transaction MUST be initiated if required.</t>

<section anchor="session-termination"><name>Session Termination</name>
<t>The session MUST be terminated if at least one of the following conditions occur:
* After a time-out of no activity occurs.
* If the Wallet does not want to receive any further requests.
* If the Verifier does not want to send any further requests.</t>
<t>A Wallet or Verifier has two options to send the termination message:
* To send the status code for session termination.
* To send the &quot;End&quot; command defined in <xref target="connection-state-values"></xref></t>
<t>If the intent to terminate the session is received, the Wallet and Verifier MUST perform at least the following actions:
* Destruction of session keys and related ephemeral key material
* Closure of the communication channel used for data retrieval.</t>

ToDo: clarify that signing connection setup is not defined?
ToDo: Mandating SHA256 for now.
ToDo: The contents of the Alternative Carrier Record and Carrier Configuration Record(s) MUST comply with    Clause 8.3.3.1.1.2.</t>

The Wallet MUST use the following identifier: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01.</t>
<t>The Wallet and Verifier MUST keep a separate message counter for each session key. The message counter value MUST be a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer. For the first encryption with a session key, the message counter MUST be set to 1. Before each following encryption with the same key, the message counter value MUST be increased by 1. A message counter value MUST never be reused in any future encryption using the same key. The AAD (Additional Authenticated Data defined in NIST SP 800-38D) used as input for the GCM function MUST be an empty string. The plaintext used as input for the GCM function MUST be Wallet request or Wallet response. The value of the data element in the session establishment and session data messages as defined in 9.1.1.4 MUST be the concatenation of the ciphertext and all 16 bytes of the authentication tag (ciphertext || authentication tag).</t>

<t>To ensure that the Wallet is connected to the correct Verifier. The Wallet may verify the Ident characteristic as described in Clause 8.3.3.1.4. The Ident characteristic value MUST be calculated using the following procedure:</t>
<t>Use HKDF an defined in RFC 5869 with the following parameters:
* Hash: SHA-256
* IKM: EdeviceKeyBytes (see Clause 9.1.1.4)
* salt: (no salt value is provided)
* info:”BLEIdent” (encoded as ASCII string)
* L: 16 octets
If the Ident characteristic received from the Verifier does not match the expected value, the Wallet MUST disconnect from the Verifier.</t>
<t>NOTE The purpose of the Ident characteristic is only to verify whether the Wallet is connected to the correct Verifier before setting starting OpenID4VP Request. If the Wallet is connected to the wrong Verifier, session establishment will fail. Connecting and disconnecting to an Verifier takes a relatively large amount of time and it is therefore fastest to implement methods to identify the correct Verifier to connect to and not to rely purely on the Ident characteristic to identify the correct Verifier.</t>
